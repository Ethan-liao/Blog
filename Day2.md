### Goals for D2
- [ ] Codewars 1 kata
- [X] Drumkit
- [X] finish react tutorial up to section 3


#### What I learnt from React tutorial

Revisted the following:
- Difference between a class(functions containing an object, like a template), constructor(methods for creating and initializing an object), and method(function that can be called within another method to manipulate elements in an object)
- Create a constructor within a class similar to creating multiple functions and reusing them.
- pass information through props
